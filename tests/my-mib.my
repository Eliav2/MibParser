                      "The vendor's authoritative identification of the
                      network management subsystem contained in the
                      entity.  This value is allocated within the SMI
                      enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an
                      easy and unambiguous means for determining `what
                      kind of box' is being managed.  For example, if
                      vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the
                      subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the
                      identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1 to its `Fred
                      Router'."
